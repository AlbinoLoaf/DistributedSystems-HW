to run this program first you have to clone the repository, then open the HW-03 folder in your code-editor.

then you start up a terminal and paste this line in to start the server "go run server/server.go -port 5454"

to start a client you open another terminal and write something like this line "go run client/client.go -sPort 5454 -n Jerrome"
the sPort has to be the same as the port you gave the server and the -n is the name you want to give the client. 

to write a message as a client you just write the message and hit enter
to leave you write leave in the clients terminal
